Web Composer is developed by Burak Boz. You can find more information [here](https://www.burakboz.net).


## Usage

To use Web Composer through the web interface:

1. Upload the `web-composer.php` file to the document root directory of your project on your web server.
2. Access the script via a web browser by navigating to `http://yourwebsite.com/path-to-web-composer/web-composer.php`.

Web Composer utilizes Composer to manage your project's dependencies. By default, development dependencies are not installed, and the autoloader is optimized.
